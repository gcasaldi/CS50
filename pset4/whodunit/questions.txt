1.  <stdint.h> is one of the headers where the new integer types, Fixed-width integer types, are defined.

2.  uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t and uint64_t is equivalent to unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int and unsigned long long respectively.
    Having precisely defined types would make the program easier and safer to port. The machine won't have trouble interpreting it across different x-bit machines.
    With <stdint.h>, what you type is what you get.

3.  The bytes of the following types:

    BYTE =  1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG =  4 bytes
    WORD =  2 bytes

4.  The first 2 bytes of a BMP file in ASCII must be "B" and "M".

5.  biSize is the number of bytes (14) that is required by the structure BITMAPINFOHEADER.
    bfSize is the overall size, in bytes, of the bitmap file (biSizeImage + 54).

6.  If the biHeight is negative, it means that the bitmap is a top-down DIB (Device-Independent Bitmap) and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel. This value is the implied bit depth of the uncompressed image, after the image has been decoded.

8.  fopen can return NULL in various circumstances like:
    - The file doesn't exist.
    - The file is opened in a mode that doesn't allow other accesses.
    - The network is down.
    - The file exists, but you don't have permissions.

9.  The 1 in the fread code indicates the quantity needed. Since there is only 1 BITMAPINFOHEADER, that's why we have 1.

10. The value would be 3.

11. fseek sets the file position. It can be used to change the offset, or location of the file pointer.

12. SEEK_CUR is one of the symbolic constants which specifies that offset is a count of characters from the current file position.
    This could be a positive or negative.
